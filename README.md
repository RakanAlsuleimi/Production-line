# Production-line
Use Arduino, Ultrasonic sensor and Servo motor for separate a different sizes of boxes in a production line
Put the sensor at hight of 1 meter at the beginning of the production line, then by the distance from the sensor to the top of the box the hight of the box will be found.
The size of the box is X*X*X so the size will be found from the hight
